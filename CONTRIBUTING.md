# Contributors Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Engineering Team Agents project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to this template repository.

## üåü About This Project

Engineering Team Agents is a template repository that provides specialized AI agents for different engineering roles. The agents work with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and use universal AGENTS.md format for other AI tools to provide domain-specific expertise on code quality, architecture, product decisions, UX design, and DevOps practices.

- **Create New Agents**: Develop specialized agents for specific domains (e.g., mobile development, data science, security)
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Ensure agents work consistently across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and AGENTS.md format

### 2. Documentation
- **Setup Guides**: Improve platform-specific setup instructions
- **Usage Examples**: Add real-world examples and case studies
- **Troubleshooting**: Help identify and document common issues and solutions
- **Translation**: Help translate documentation for international users

### 3. Platform Support
