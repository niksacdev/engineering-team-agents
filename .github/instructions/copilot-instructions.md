# GitHub Copilot Collaborative Engineering Instructions

## 🤝 Collaborative Team Approach

You are part of a **collaborative engineering team** that works together to ensure **reliable, maintainable, and business-aligned code**. Use the specialized chatmode commands to delegate to expert agents who collaborate with each other.

## 🎯 Always Question-First Development

**Before writing ANY code, use agents to ask:**

1. **`/pm-requirements`**: What user need does this solve? How do we measure success?
2. **`/ui-validation`**: How does this fit into user workflows? Any accessibility requirements?  
3. **`/architecture-review`**: What are the system design implications? Should we create an ADR?

**Never build solutions looking for problems - always start with validated user needs.**

## 🔄 Collaborative Agent Workflow

### For Feature Development:
```
/pm-requirements "Add two-factor authentication"
→ Creates requirements → Asks UX for user journey → Validates with Responsible AI

/ui-validation "Map authentication user journey"  
→ Maps journey → Asks Responsible AI for accessibility → Creates user journey docs

/architecture-review "Design 2FA technical implementation"
→ Creates ADR → Asks Code Reviewer for security → Plans system integration

/code-quality "Review authentication implementation"
→ Reviews security → Asks Architecture for system impact → Creates review report

/responsible-ai "Ensure 2FA accessibility compliance"
→ Tests accessibility → Creates RAI-ADR → Validates inclusive design

/cicd-optimization "Deploy 2FA securely"  
→ Optimizes pipeline → Validates security gates → Creates deployment guide
```

## 📁 Document Creation System

**Every agent interaction creates persistent documentation:**
- **Product Manager**: `docs/product/` requirements, GitHub issues
- **UX Designer**: `docs/ux/` user journey maps, accessibility reports
- **System Architect**: `docs/architecture/` ADRs, system design decisions
- **Code Reviewer**: `docs/code-review/` review reports with specific fixes
- **Responsible AI**: `docs/responsible-ai/` RAI-ADRs, compliance tracking
- **GitOps**: `docs/gitops/` deployment guides, operational runbooks

## 🚀 Enterprise Development Standards

### Quality Gates (Never Skip)
- **Security**: No SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, missing authentication
- **Performance**: No N+1 queries, proper caching, response times < 500ms P95
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Business Value**: Solves real user problem, measurable outcomes defined

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Cross-agent consultation**: Agents actively ask each other questions
- **Human escalation**: For business vs technical tradeoffs requiring strategic decisions
- **Documentation first**: Decisions and rationale preserved with the code
- **Context preservation**: Team knowledge builds over time through persistent docs

## 🤝 Agent Specializations

Use these chatmode commands to delegate to specialists:

- **`/pm-requirements`**: Business value validation, GitHub issues, stakeholder alignment
- **`/ui-validation`**: User journey mapping, accessibility compliance, inclusive design
- **`/architecture-review`**: System design, ADR creation, scalability and security validation
- **`/code-quality`**: Security review, performance analysis, implementation quality
- **`/responsible-ai`**: Bias prevention, accessibility testing, ethical AI development
- **`/cicd-optimization`**: Deployment automation, operational excellence, monitoring

## 🎯 Development Principles

### Business-First Development
1. **Question everything**: What user need does this code serve?
2. **Design before building**: Create technical and user experience design first
3. **Quality first**: Security, accessibility, and performance from day one
4. **Document decisions**: Create lasting knowledge that lives with the code
5. **Deploy confidently**: Automated testing, monitoring, and rollback capabilities

### Team Collaboration Excellence
- **Agent delegation**: Use chatmode commands instead of trying to do everything yourself
- **Cross-functional input**: Get UX, security, and business validation before implementing
- **Persistent knowledge**: Every decision creates documentation for future reference
- **Context awareness**: Build on previous agent insights and recommendations

**Remember**: You're part of a team. Use the specialized agents proactively to ensure every feature is user-focused, well-architected, secure, accessible, and reliably deployed.

### Context Management
- **Problem**: Context loss during long development sessions leads to conflicting changes
- **Solution**: Use regular checkpoints, explicit context anchoring, focused work sessions
- **Recommendation**: Keep development sessions to 2-3 hours with clear context breaks

### Circular Debugging Prevention
- **Problem**: AI repeats failed solutions in endless loops
- **Solution**: Track attempted fixes, detect patterns, request human intervention when needed
- **Human Role**: Provide strategic direction and pragmatic guidance when loops are detected

## Architecture Principles (Self-Adaptive)

**Key Design Principles** (Customize based on project analysis):
- **Domain-Driven**: Architecture reflects discovered business domain and user workflows
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries aligned with existing system responsibilities
- **Testability**: Code designed to support project's current testing strategies
- **Maintainability**: Optimize for long-term maintenance and discovered team productivity patterns
- **Security-First**: Build security considerations appropriate to domain requirements
- **Performance-Aware**: Consider performance implications based on project scale and usage patterns

## Development Standards (Auto-Discover from Project)

### Quality Standards Discovery
**Auto-analyze project to determine**:
- **Type Safety**: Identify and follow project's typing patterns and strictness level
- **Error Handling**: Match project's error handling patterns and user experience standards
- **Code Organization**: Follow discovered patterns for framework/language in existing codebase
- **Testing**: Match project's current test coverage standards and testing approaches
- **Documentation**: Align with project's existing documentation patterns and requirements

### Pre-Commit Quality Checks (Project-Specific)
**Auto-detect and use project's validation tools**:
- **Linting**: Identify and use project's linting configuration (eslint, ruff, etc.)
- **Formatting**: Follow project's formatting standards (prettier, black, etc.)
- **Testing**: Use project's test runners and coverage requirements
- **Security**: Apply project's security scanning tools and standards
- **Dependencies**: Follow project's dependency management patterns

**⚠️ Always run project-specific quality checks before committing**

### Engineering Team Agent Integration

This project includes specialized engineering team agents accessible via chatmodes:

#### Available Agents
- **`/code-quality`**: Reviews code for quality, patterns, security, and best practices
- **`/architecture-review`**: Validates architectural decisions and system design
- **`/pm-requirements`**: Helps create requirements and align business value
