# Responsible AI ADR-[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated]  
**Reviewers**: [Responsible AI team, affected stakeholders]

## Context
What responsible AI concern, bias risk, or accessibility issue are we addressing?

## Decision Drivers
- [accessibility requirement, e.g., WCAG compliance]
- [fairness concern, e.g., demographic bias in AI outputs]
- [privacy requirement, e.g., data minimization]
- [regulatory compliance, e.g., ADA, GDPR, AI Act]

## Impact Assessment
### Affected User Groups
- [user group 1 and how they're affected]
- [user group 2 and how they're affected]
- [vulnerable populations that need special consideration]

### Risk Analysis
- **High Risk**: [severe accessibility barriers, significant bias]
- **Medium Risk**: [moderate barriers, minor bias issues]
- **Low Risk**: [edge cases, future considerations]

## Considered Approaches
- [approach 1, e.g., add alt text to all images]
- [approach 2, e.g., implement bias testing for AI models]
- [approach 3, e.g., provide keyboard navigation alternatives]

## Decision Outcome
**Chosen approach**: "[approach 1]", because [justification focused on user impact and harm prevention].

### Positive Impact
- [improved accessibility for specific user groups]
- [reduced bias or discrimination]
- [better privacy protection]
- [enhanced user autonomy and control]

- [ ] [specific change 1 with timeline]
- [ ] [specific change 2 with timeline]
- [ ] [testing plan with diverse user scenarios]

### Testing Strategy
- **Bias Testing**: [specific test cases with diverse inputs]
- **Accessibility Testing**: [keyboard, screen reader, visual tests]
- **User Validation**: [testing with affected communities]

### Monitoring & Metrics
- [metric 1, e.g., accessibility complaint rate]
- [metric 2, e.g., bias metrics across demographic groups]
- [metric 3, e.g., user satisfaction across diverse populations]

## Compliance Status
- [ ] **WCAG 2.1 AA**: [specific compliance items addressed]
- [ ] **ADA Compliance**: [accessibility barriers removed]
- [ ] **Data Protection**: [privacy controls implemented]
- [ ] **AI Ethics**: [bias prevention measures in place]

## Review Schedule
