# 🤝 Collaborative Engineering Team Agents

Transform your IDE into a **collaborative engineering environment** where specialized agents work together to ensure **reliable, maintainable, and business-aligned code**.

> **Experimental Repository**: The methodologies and opinions expressed herein are those of individual contributors and do not represent any organization's views.

This collaborative agent system was developed based on learnings from experimental multi-agent research documented in:
- [Beyond Vibe Coding: A Multi-Agent Approach to Software Engineering](https://www.appliedcontext.ai/p/beyond-vibe-coding-a-multi-agent) 
- Github: [https://github.com/niksacdev/multi-agent-system](https://github.com/niksacdev/multi-agent-system)

## 🎯 The Approach

**Traditional AI**: Single assistant, generic responses, no persistent knowledge
**Our Approach**: **Specialized team members** that collaborate, create documentation, and build institutional knowledge

Leverages Claude SubAgents and GitHub Copilot chatmodes, with universal AGENTS.md format for broad tool compatibility

## 🏢 Enterprise-Grade Collaborative Agents

**Enterprise-Ready Platforms**: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) • [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) • Plus universal AGENTS.md support for other AI tools

### 🏆 Enterprise Benefits
- **Security-First**: Guidance based on OWASP principles and secure coding practices
- **Audit Trail**: All agent decisions create persistent documentation
- **Accessibility Focused**: Guidance based on WCAG 2.1 principles and inclusive design
- **Scalable Patterns**: Architecture guidance for enterprise-scale considerations
- **Vendor Agnostic**: Works across multiple AI platforms and tools

### 🔄 Always Question-First Development

Every feature request follows this **collaborative workflow**:

1. **🔍 Product Manager** asks: "What user need does this solve? How do we measure success?"
2. **🎨 UX Designer** maps user journeys and validates accessibility requirements  
3. **🏛️ System Architect** ensures secure, scalable design and creates Architecture Decision Records
4. **🔍 Code Reviewer** validates security, reliability, and implementation quality
5. **🌍 Responsible AI** prevents bias and ensures inclusive, accessible design
6. **🚀 GitOps Specialist** optimizes deployment and operational excellence

**Result**: Every feature is **user-focused**, **well-architected**, **secure**, **accessible**, and **reliably deployed**.

### 🤝 Your Collaborative Engineering Team

Each agent creates **persistent documentation** and collaborates with teammates:


| Agent | Collaborative Role | Creates Documentation | Delegates To |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **📊 Product Manager** | Clarifies user needs, validates business value | `docs/product/` requirements, GitHub issues | UX Designer for user journeys |
| **🎨 UX Designer** | Maps user journeys, ensures accessibility | `docs/ux/` user journey maps, design reports | Responsible AI for WCAG compliance |
| **🏛️ System Architect** | Creates ADRs, validates security, reliablility, scalability | `docs/architecture/` ADRs, system designs | Code Reviewer for security review |
| **🔍 Code Reviewer** | Reviews security, quality, performance | `docs/code-review/` detailed review reports | DevOps for deployment concerns |
| **🌍 Responsible AI** | Prevents bias, ensures accessibility | `docs/responsible-ai/` RAI-ADRs, compliance tracking | UX Designer for accessibility validation |
| **🚀 GitOps Specialist** | Optimizes CI/CD, deployment reliability | `docs/gitops/` deployment guides, runbooks | Code Reviewer for security gates |

### 🔗 Cross-Agent Collaboration Examples

**Feature Development Flow:**
```
Feature Request → Product Manager (requirements) 
              → UX Designer (user journey) 
              → System Architect (technical design)
              → Code Reviewer (implementation quality)
              → Responsible AI (bias & accessibility check)
              → GitOps (deployment optimization)
```

**Complex Decision Making:**
- **Product Manager** to **UX Designer**: "Can you map the user journey for this checkout flow?"
- **UX Designer** to **Responsible AI**: "Any accessibility barriers with this interface design?"
- **System Architect** to **Code Reviewer**: "Security implications of this microservices approach?"
- **Code Reviewer** to **GitOps**: "Any deployment concerns with this database migration?"


## ⚡ Setup

### 1. Install Collaborative Agent System

```bash
# Clone the collaborative engineering template
git clone https://github.com/niksacdev/engineering-team-agents.git

# Navigate to YOUR project repository  
cd /path/to/your-project

# Install collaborative agents for your IDE:
cp -r ../engineering-team-agents/.claude ./           # Claude Code agents
cp -r ../engineering-team-agents/.github ./          # GitHub Copilot agents  
cp ../engineering-team-agents/AGENTS.md ./            # Universal AI tool support
cp ../engineering-team-agents/claude.md ./           # Collaborative instructions
```

**Windows users:** Replace `cp -r` with `xcopy /E /I` and `cp` with `copy`

### 2. Setup Documentation System

**Important**: Agents create persistent documentation in a structured `docs/` folder. 

```bash
# Create documentation structure (will be auto-populated by agents)
mkdir -p docs/{product,ux,architecture,code-review,responsible-ai,gitops,templates}

# Copy documentation templates  
cp -r ../engineering-team-agents/docs/templates/* docs/templates/
```

**To customize documentation locations:**
1. Edit agent files in `.claude/agents/`, `.github/chatmodes/`, or `AGENTS.md`
2. Update the `docs/[folder]/` paths to your preferred locations
3. Ensure templates exist in your specified template directory

### 3. Initialize Your Domain-Specific Team

Each IDE has a collaborative initialization process that customizes agents for YOUR project:

| Platform | Support Level | Setup Guide | Key Features |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | ⭐ Full | [Setup Guide](docs/setup/claude-setup.md) | Specialized agents via Task tool, ADR creation, cross-agent consultation |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ⭐ Full | [Setup Guide](docs/setup/github-copilot-setup.md) | Collaborative chatmodes, team handoffs, persistent documentation |
| **Other AI Tools** | ✅ Basic | [Setup Guide](docs/setup/universal-agents-setup.md) | Universal format for broad tool compatibility (not individually tested) |

**Support Levels Explained:**
- **⭐ Full Support**: Thoroughly tested, enterprise features, active development, comprehensive documentation
- **✅ Basic Support**: Universal AGENTS.md format provides basic collaborative patterns but not individually tested per tool

### 4. Examples

**Question-First Development Pattern:**
```bash
# 1. Always start with user needs (not technical solutions)
"Use product-manager-advisor: Add user authentication to our app"
→ PM creates requirements → asks UX for user journey → validates with Responsible AI

# 2. Design before building  
"Use ux-ui-designer: Map user journey for authentication flow"
→ UX maps journey → asks Architecture for technical constraints → creates documentation

# 3. Validate everything with specialists
"Use code-reviewer: Review this authentication implementation"  
→ Code Reviewer checks security → asks Architecture for system impact → creates review report
```

**Result**: Every interaction creates documentation and enables **cross-specialist collaboration** that builds institutional knowledge.
